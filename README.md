*Built with assistance from Claude.*

> **Part of a connected portfolio.** The customer universe in this project (user IDs, plan types, churn status) is drawn from the same data model as [metrics-store](https://github.com/theotherbrandonsoto/metrics-store), simulating what a real multi-system analytics environment looks like.


## 📌 Executive Summary

### The Business Problem
Support tickets are one of the richest signals in a SaaS business — but extracting meaning from them at scale is slow and manual. Without a consistent taxonomy and automated analysis, patterns stay buried in a queue while product and CS teams make decisions without the full picture.

### The Solution
This pipeline ingests raw support tickets, uses Claude to validate a structured taxonomy and assign sentiment and urgency scores, and surfaces the results in a live Streamlit dashboard with an AI analytics agent. The output is a prioritized product gap report — generated automatically, no analyst hours required.

### Project Impact
What typically takes an analyst several hours of ticket sampling, manual tagging, and write-up is compressed into a single pipeline run. 660 tickets are labeled, enriched, and ready for stakeholder consumption in under 3 minutes — with a Claude-generated strategic narrative already written in the voice of a senior operator.

### Next Steps
In a production environment, this pipeline would ingest tickets directly from a CRM or support platform (Zendesk, Salesforce) via API rather than from a generated CSV, with results written to a shared cloud warehouse. Planned feature additions include real-time ticket ingestion for same-day trend visibility and a feedback loop where agents can flag misclassified labels to retrain the taxonomy prompt over time.

## 🧠 What is Transcript Analysis?

Every ticket is a customer telling you exactly where your product is failing them.

This project builds a lightweight version of what tools like unitQ do at scale: ingest raw support contacts, apply a structured taxonomy using an AI classifier, and surface the patterns that matter most to product and customer success teams.

The result is a system that turns a pile of support tickets into a prioritized product gap report — automatically.

## 🏷️ Taxonomy Design

Tickets are classified across three levels. The taxonomy is hardcoded — ensuring consistency across runs and reflecting how real CS ops teams actually work.

| Primary | Secondary Examples | Tertiary Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Billing** | Duplicate Charge, Failed Payment, Refund Request | Subscription Upgrade Flow, Payment Method Update |
| **Online Ordering** | Page Not Loading, Menu Not Updating, Order Not Received | Checkout Flow, POS Sync |
| **Marketing / SEO** | Google Listing Issue, Website Not Updating | GMB Sync, SEO Ranking Drop |
| **Product / Feature** | Feature Not Working, Performance Issue, Integration Issue | Dashboard, Notifications |
| **Account Access** | Login Issue, Permissions Error, Account Locked | SSO Failure, 2FA Problem |
| **Onboarding** | Setup Confusion, Integration Help, Go-Live Issue | POS Connection, Domain Setup |

## 📐 dbt Layer Design

| Layer | Model | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Staging | `stg_support_tickets` | Cleans types, validates accepted label values |
| Marts | `fct_support_tickets` | One row per ticket with churn risk + sentiment flags |
| Insights | `support_insights` | Aggregated metrics by category, plan type, and month |

## 🤖 Claude Integration

Claude is used in two places:

**1. Taxonomy Validation (`analyze.py`)**
Each ticket body is sent to Claude in batches. Claude confirms or corrects the primary/secondary label, assigns sentiment, scores urgency (1–3), and writes a one-line summary. The taxonomy is passed as a strict constraint so Claude cannot freelance new categories.

**2. Product Gap Narrative (`analyze.py`)**
After labeling, Claude receives the aggregated ticket volume by category alongside the churn breakdown. It generates a 4–6 sentence strategic narrative identifying the top product gaps and highest-priority interventions — written in the voice of a senior operator presenting to a VP.

**3. Analytics Agent (`dashboard.py`)**
The Streamlit dashboard includes a natural language chat agent with full awareness of the current data context. Example questions:
- *"Which category has the highest churn signal rate?"*
- *"What should the product team prioritize this quarter?"*
- *"Are Basic plan customers more frustrated than Premium?"*
- *"Which issues are most likely to cause a customer to cancel?"*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- An [Anthropic account](https://console.anthropic.com) with an API key

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theotherbrandonsoto/transcript-analysis.git
cd transcript-analysis
```

### 2. Set up virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY to .env
```

### 4. Generate ticket data

```bash
python scripts/generate_tickets.py
```

### 5. Run Claude analysis pipeline

```bash
python scripts/analyze.py
```

This will validate all ticket labels and generate the product gap narrative. Takes ~2–3 minutes for 660 tickets.

### 6. Run the dbt pipeline

```bash
cd dbt_project
dbt run
dbt test
cd ..
```

### 7. Launch the dashboard

```bash
streamlit run scripts/dashboard.py
```

Open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## 🧪 Data Quality Tests

dbt tests run automatically across the pipeline:

- **Uniqueness** — `ticket_id` is unique across all models
- **Not null** — key columns are never empty
- **Accepted values** — `primary_label` and `sentiment` only contain valid taxonomy values

Run at any time:

```bash
cd dbt_project
dbt test
```

## 💡 Why This Project?

Most analytics projects stop at a dashboard. This one is designed to reflect what a real customer strategy function actually needs:

- **Taxonomy as code** — business classification logic lives in version-controlled Python, not in a spreadsheet or a vendor tool
- **AI-augmented, not AI-dependent** — Claude validates and enriches labels, but the taxonomy and data model are fully human-designed and auditable
- **Retention-first framing** — every metric is connected back to churn risk, not just ticket volume
- **Actionable output** — the product gap narrative is something a VP of CS or CPO would actually read and act on
- **Connected data model** — customer IDs link directly to the [metrics-store](https://github.com/theotherbrandonsoto/metrics-store) project, demonstrating how real multi-system analytics environments work
